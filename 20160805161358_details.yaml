Definition of modelled factor: >
    The factor given here is the insert factor defined as the portion of the 
    electron output factor that is dependent on the insert alone. The electron 
    output factor is defined as per AAPM TG 25  as the ratio of dose per 
    monitor unit at dmax.

Measurement details: >
    Insert factors were measured in RW3 with an Advanced Markus on an Elekta 
    Agility linac. When the depth of maximum dose was shifted from the reference 
    depth this depth was searched for to a 1 mm resolution. All depth differences 
    took into account stopping power ratio corrections as per the protocol in 
    IAEA TRS 398.

Insert shielding material: Cerrobend
